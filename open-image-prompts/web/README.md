# Open Image Prompts Web

React and Vite gallery for exploring the image and prompt collection.

Run commands from the repository root:

```bash
npm run setup
npm run dev
```

The first run expands `../db/prompts.db.gz` once under the ignored
`.oip/runtime/` directory. The cross-platform Node launcher finds Python,
starts the read-only SQLite API, and then starts Vite. The browser fetches
paginated JSON while Vite serves the fetched images from `../images/`, falling
back to each record's original source URL when a file was not downloaded.

Useful environment variables:

- `OIP_DB_PATH`: decompressed SQLite path.
- `OIP_DB_ARCHIVE_PATH`: source `.db.gz` path.
- `OIP_WEB_HOST`: frontend bind address (default `127.0.0.1`).
- `OIP_WEB_PORT`: frontend port. When set, the port is strict: a collision fails
  loudly instead of moving to another port. When unset, Vite picks the next free
  port starting at `5173` and prints the URL it actually serves.
- `OIP_STARTUP_TIMEOUT`: seconds to wait for the SQLite API to report ready
  (default `180`). The first start expands the archive into a ~270 MB database,
  which can exceed a short budget on a constrained machine.
- `OIP_API_HOST`: API bind address (default `127.0.0.1`).
- `OIP_API_PORT`: API port (default `8787`).
- `OIP_API_QUERY_CONCURRENCY`: maximum concurrent SQLite page/search queries
  (default `4`).
- `OIP_API_QUERY_WAIT_SECONDS`: how long a request waits for a query slot before
  receiving `503` (default `3`).
- `OIP_API_CACHE_ENTRIES`: maximum in-memory paginated response cache entries
  (default `128`).

Search uses the archive's SQLite FTS5 index across source prompts,
translations, authors, tools, and visual labels. The API bounds concurrent
queries and keeps a small LRU response cache so one busy search cannot create
an unbounded number of SQLite scans. Search text is submitted explicitly with
Enter or the Search button, so typing and IME composition do not trigger API
requests.

`npm run preview` builds the frontend and runs the production preview with the
same local API and image service on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
